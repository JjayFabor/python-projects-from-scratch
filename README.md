# Python Projects From Scratch 🐍

A curated collection of beginner to advanced Python projects, built from scratch to master the fundamentals of programming, problem-solving, and real-world application design.

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository serves as a structured 21-day challenge to:

- Strengthen core Python skills
- Relearn and apply fundamental programming concepts
- Practice real-world problem-solving from scratch
- Prepare for coding interviews with zero AI assistance
- Rebuild focus after relying too much on ChatGPT for fast solutions

> 💬 **Note from me**: I realized that once AI tools became popular, I started coding by vibes—skimming documentation and depending on generated code. This repo is my way back to solid fundamentals, written and understood line by line.

## 🛠️ Guidelines

- All code is written **from scratch**, without AI/code-completion tools.
- Each project focuses on specific Python concepts and problem-solving strategies.
- Designed for 2–3 hours of daily practice.
